## Background: 
Aphasia is an acquired language disorder that affects the production and comprehension of speech. Speech therapy to rehabilitate aphasia is expensive and not always accessible. People with aphasia may struggle to translate the improvements they make in speech therapy to real world environments.

This app allows users to practice rehabilitation exercises without the aide of their therapist. Stimuli displayed in exercises is customized to the users location to bridge gap between clinical and real world improvements. The stimuli displayed in the app is personalizable; users can take photos of image and the app will classify the object and generate new exercises.
